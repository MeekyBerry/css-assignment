                        This Website is the collaborative result of an assignment
                        worked on by the team of Aleksandras Bileviƒçius, Ashley
                        Nyasha Mlambo, Elue Michael, and Owen Lenihan for Brainnest's second week.

                    <p>
                        Using the template given to us for the assignment,
                    we decided to use theme the site as a cinema's site
                    listing currently airing films in the movies page along
                    with creating a FAQ that you could plausibly see on a 
                    cinema's other pages. 
                    <br><br>
                    The next few questions are to padding to make this to look
                    more official and are taken from a local cinema's FAQ.

                    <p>
                        Audio Desc' or Audio Description is a feature we offer 
                        for the visually impaired in some of our cinemas in 
                        Northern Ireland. This along with general sound track 
                        describes the setting and scenes within the film. You 
                        will require a headset which can be obtained at the box 
                        office. This does not affect the general viewing of the 
                        film. Audio Description films are listed with 
                        'Audio Desc ' beside the show time. If you would like to 
                        confirm whether you local Omniplex cinema offers Audio 
                        Description headsets, please contact the cinema direct 
                        - a full list of contact details can be found here.

                        Movies classified 15A are considered to have parts of the 
                        film which are suitable for those over the age of 15 by 
                        the Irish Films Classification Office. However, they can 
                        also be seen by a person younger than 15 years provided 
                        they are accompanied by an adult over the age of 18.
